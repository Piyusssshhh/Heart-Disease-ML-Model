 ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction (Machine Learning)

 📌 Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning system to predict the risk of heart disease using structured patient health data. 
The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, 
with a strong focus on medical reliability.

 🎯 Objective
To build a robust classification model that can accurately identify patients at risk of heart disease,prioritizing high recall to minimize false 
negatives, which is critical in medical diagnosis.
